            How I stay committed to learning
        </h2>
        <p>
        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
        projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
        <p>
        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey
        with the world.</p>
        <h2> How I got started</h2>
        <p>
        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. Aftereach learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of
        what I learned using my own words.</p>
        <p>
        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
        others learn and stay motivated.</p>
